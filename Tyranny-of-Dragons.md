Whole buncha shit happened. gg.

Players:
* Vortex Dragon Utureshk
 * Motivation: Chaos
* Three Dreaded Ones
 * Motivation: Incite chaos
* Spirits
 * Motivation: Protect the world
* Gods (MUCH weakened)
 * Motivation: Gain control
* The party of apparently-incredibly-powerful dickwads.
 * Motivation: ???
 
Given all this information, what is the most likely course of events?
* The Three Dreaded Ones approach Utureshk, licking her wounds, and the gods, drunk on newfound power, and start the war. Utureshk is the catalyst; the Three were biding their time.

How does this involve the players? How do I get them engaged?
* Three Dreaded Ones approach them, get a feel for their intentions (use Kalt Peter, dressed in very pristine whites, speaking telepathically; has a disdain for speech). Reveal very little, and what little is revealed is complete lies (+11 deception)
 * Protector of the world, responsible for gatekeeping
 * He accuses them of interloping, and staging an attack on this world
 * He and his compatriots are preparing an attack against Utureshk, and need help
 * If they agree, he takes them to a demiplane of pure, stark, brilliance - of Acruum's design. Bureaucracy is not a bad idea here
 * Convinces them to embark on a fight against some minor "interlopers" (actually the spirits who cast him out)
 * Tells them where to find them (Jungles of Urush, in the Legendary City of Ultino).
