Objectives:

* Push the "Spirits are being corrupted" angle
* Get the players to realize that Halinaxus is a spirit
* Push the Old Gods vibe:
	* Halinaxus is Deathwing but also N'zoth
    * Utureshk is Sargeras
    * Halinaxus is wreaking havoc because he's been awoken, earthquakes all over the place
    * If Halinaxus is destroyed, every red dragon ever becomes Vortex-touched and fucking insane
    
Player's Objectives:

* Search for more dragons.
	* Not much I can prep here; they have an idea, I determine its success.
* Knox wants to talk to Investi about Utureshk, Halinaxus, and where dragons live
	* Investi is thoroughly surprised that not only does Halinaxus actually exist, they confronted him and lived
    * He's a bit suspicious of their power (push them to lie about being gods)
    * Dragons are incredibly solitary and familial, and they all descend from five Progenitor Dragons, each of whom is a spirit:
    	* Halinaxus, Red (M); Spirit of the Eternal Molten Core
        * Livjatan, Blue (F); Spirit of the Fury of the Sky
        * Mnementh, Black (M); Spirit of the Sulfurous Depths
        * Glaurung, Green (M); Spirit of the Slimy Dark
        * Chrysophylax, White (F); Spirit of the Wintry Peak
