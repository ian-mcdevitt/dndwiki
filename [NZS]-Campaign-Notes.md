Hooks:

[[Copper Dragon|Tefydarian]] swoops down in town center:
* Grabs someone ([[Lana Spiderbash|Families: Spiderbash]])
* Says his hoard was plundered - demands 1000g
* Is actually insane; magic item in his hoard makes him think he was robbed

Druid:
* Very-targetted lightning strikes
* Wild bear attacks on the west side of town
* (Much later) Treant attack

Kalt Peter:
* The aura of silence gets larger, engulfs the entire house
* Peter has a bloody wound on his arm - got attacked by a grell in the house

Today, I'd like to push the Hakour issue.
* Have the Spiderbash family introduce themselves; offer their life savings for their daughter back. The youngest son offers to come help.
 * Try to get the players to ask about their surname; it's a clue towards the druid (giant spider crawled out from under their house shortly after building it, was killed by the eldest son with a piece of timber
* Focus on getting them to realize that a lot of the issues the town has had as it grew were not just random catastrophes; they were druid things.
 * A flash-flood, ruining a crop one year (control water)
 * Locusts destroyed a crop another year (insect plague)
 * People disappearing in the woods (grasping vine)
 * An epidemic (contagion)
 * Firemaw child went insane, killed his sister (geas)
* Definitely have the bear attack. And not just one bear; a bunch of brown bears, invading a house. Very aggressive, attack whatever is most threatening.
* People start to leave town, state that the issues are too much.
* Then throw the lightning at them.
