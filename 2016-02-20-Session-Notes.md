Opening Narration

We find ourselves, as we resume, standing on ground made of pockmarked, brittle volcanic rock, which stretches outwards from the hall behind you, into a massive lava-filled cavern at the bottom of a volcanic dungeon. Scattered throughout the room is the occasional jagged volcanic rock, jutting out from the lava pool, into which flows a river of magma from the south. The heat in the room is oppressive, as you struggle to catch your breath among the sulfurous haze, and sweat beads on your brow. At the far north of the room, just beyond the end of the peninsula, stands a massive statue made of obsidian, with lava pouring from its eyes and mouth, above which hovers a sphere of light so bright as to be painful to gaze upon.

You are accompanied by five Adherents of the Eternal Flame, who have begged of you to calm their inconsolably angered master, known as Halinaxus. At your behest, a sixth adherent, a tiefling woman, says a quick incantation, and plunges a sacrificial dagger into her wrist, letting her blood pour into a magnificent pillared cauldron at the edge of the peninsula. No sooner does the first drop touch the bottom of the cauldron than the massive sphere begins to vibrate. As it begins shaking more and more wildly, the ground beneath you does the same, in perfect unison. The sphere begins to warp and reshape, and as the quakes reach their crescendo, and everyone is thrown around, the sphere finally resolves itself into the form of a massive dragon, larger than any you've seen, triumphantly spreading its wings.

The quaking stops, and the dragon takes wing, beginning to fly lazy circles around the room.

"Who are you to wake Halinaxus, the Eternal Flame?"

## Post Session Notes

* Players want to search for A Dragon, and hope that it's Halinaxus.
* Knox wants to talk to Investi about Utureshk, Halinaxus and where dragons live (Investi is thoroughly surprised that they confronted Halinaxus and lived)
* Sirah want to know if the other gods got any stronger
